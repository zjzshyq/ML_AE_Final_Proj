### Regression
1. please put the train, test csv and true y file into this dir first
2. run main.py to load training data, train it by GBM, and output the predected y.
3. test.py is to calculate the MAPE between predicted y and true y.
4. feat.py is for feature engineering, do not need to run it manually.
